# Allen &amp; Lewis Company | ***Communication***
***Communication*** lets the Allen & Lewis Company members communicate (that was short).
## Installing (Windows):
1. Download the latest release for Windows at:<br />https://github.com/blewis14/communication-allenlewisco/releases/download/0.2.4.3/setup_communication_v0.2.4.3.exe
2. When you first run the .exe file, you will see a screen that says something like,<br />"Do you want this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?" Click yes.<br />(I don't have anything in my code that can potentially harm your PC.)
3. Read through the license if you want, and then click "I accept the agreement". Click the "Next" button.
4. This screen selects the folder name on the Start Menu.<br />I recommend skipping this section, but if you know what you are doing, you can play with the settings.
5. Click "Create a desktop shortcut" and click "Next".
6. Click "Install" if you want to complete the process, or "Back" if you made a mistake.
7. Click "Finish". You have successfully installed Communication!
8. To start Communication, if it hasn't started already, double-click on the desktop<br />shortcut the installer created, or go into the Start Menu and find it there.
You're all set!
